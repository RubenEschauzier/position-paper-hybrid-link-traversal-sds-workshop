Decentralized dataspaces preserve data sovereignty by keeping data at its source,
but querying thousands of autonomous sources with heterogeneous interfaces introduces significant challenges.
% Need: Why something needed to be done at all
Traditional federated engines fail to scale to this size, and existing Link Traversal-based Query Processing (LTQP) systems treat all sources uniformly.
By ignoring the (query) capabilities of expressive interfaces, such as SPARQL endpoints,
current LTQP engines suffer performance issues.
% Task: What was undertaken to address the need
To address this, we advocate for Hybrid LTQP, an execution strategy that combines the dynamic runtime discovery of link traversal
with the performance benefits of delegating complex sub-queries to capable server-side interfaces.
% Object: What the present document does or covers
This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in hybrid traversal and identifies the critical challenges hindering its implementation:
establishing exclusive groups without prior knowledge, integrating dynamic sub-queries into active query plans, enabling reliable service discovery,
and deduplicating alternative architectural views.
% Conclusion: What the findings mean for the audience
Solving the challenges identified in this paper is a strict prerequisite
for making hybrid decentralized querying practically viable across heterogeneous dataspaces.
% Perspectives: What the future holds, beyond this work
Consequently, future research must prioritize these open problems to engineer the next generation of scalable,
interface-aware LTQP query engines.
